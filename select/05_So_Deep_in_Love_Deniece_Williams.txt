I've only scratched the surface before
And all the time
Underneath it all was this
I always knew there had to be more
Come make the world disappear
Come with me
Let's get lost in a kiss

So deep in love,
So deep in love,
So deep in love
Nothing can tear us apart

So deep in love
So deep in love
So deep in love
So deep inside my heart

No other one
No other way
For all my life
There's no other love but you
Here is the place I want to stay
Don't ever stop holding me
Never stop
Oh, whatever you do

So deep in love,
So deep in love,
So deep in love
Nothing can tear us apart

So deep in love,
So deep in love,
So deep in love
So deep inside my heart

Come make the world disappear
Come with me
Let's get lost in a kiss

So deep in love
So deep in love
So deep in love
Nothing can tear us apart
(Ooh-ooh...)

So deep in love
So deep in love
So deep in love
So deep inside my heart
Baby, baby, baby

So deep in love
So deep in love
So deep in love
Nothing can tear us apart
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...)

So deep in love
So deep in love
So deep in love
So deep inside my heart
