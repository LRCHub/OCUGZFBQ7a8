why do leaves fall
after i pick em up?
after hours with sunsets cant get enough
you pushesd me off of the swings think i fell in
love
but it only ever started cuz of alcohol
i think you never wanna see me again
just sucks cuz I know we will never be friends
thet’d always tell me i’m too deep in love
think i believe em cuz im missing sumn
december always got me thinking that I need you
i always swip up on your story like I have to
I think im falling
do you think you could stop it?
(Wow wow wow)
it kinda sucks that i think we could never be
cuz if not than you’d be to perfect me
i cant imagine how you felt but i’m not sorry
i sorta feel the same but dont say thats beyond
me
i cant talk
about you i wont
bring that up

i cant love you
but its sumn i want to
its like feeling i can’t get out
its like a feeling i can’t get out inside
you and i

im thinking it’s better on my own
im tryna find my way out of the darkness
