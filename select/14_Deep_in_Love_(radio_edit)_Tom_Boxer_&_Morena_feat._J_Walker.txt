From UK to LA
There's so many beautiful places
Hot beautiful faces
But only one stands out
Even though she's a little bit crazy
I love the challenge lady
I said ain't go to a lamborghini
But a couple of rose of martini
She wants to see the whole world
I can't afford it
My own world
I love the sound of euro
I heard it caught enormous
I wanna buy you night, night, night?
...light, light
I want you feel cut, cut
Hey baby what's up!

You would make me fall in love
Deep in love
Find a way

You would make me fall in love
Deep in love
Find a way

There's nothing in this world that can take me from my girl
Let her heart screaming
Ooo ooooo
I could be falling for last
But that ain't goog enough
Baby i'm falling for love love
I'm falling in love

Let's go!

(Morena talk to me)

I'm from venus, you're from mars
When we're together
We create stars
Falling down from earth
Falling down from earth

Im from venus, you're from mars
When we're together
We create stars
Falling down from earth
Falling down from earth

You would make me fall in love
Deep in love
Find a way
You would make me fall in love
Deep in love
Find a way

But that ain't good enough
